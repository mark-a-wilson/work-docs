# A Standard for Being Done Discovery

When a government program sets out on new a project, or has been given money to hire a development team to build a new service or digital system, we normally ask them, "_Have you done Discovery?_" 

This checklist could be used to create a shared understanding of what "Discovery work" is, and a standard against which to assess whether one has done enough "Discovery work" to move forward with a project or procurement. 

_Most of this is copied from the [Gov.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works#define-the-problem)_

**Checklist**

You are finished the Discovery phase when you can confidently back up the following statements:

- [ ] I have clearly defined the **problem** I&#39;m trying to solve.
- [ ] I have worked directly with the people who are affected by the problem. I have a thorough understanding of their **goals** and how their **needs** are (or aren&#39;t) currently being met.
- [ ] I understand the **related products/services** that exist to meet these needs and whether they&#39;re run by government or third parties.
- [ ] I have identified the people I want to help (my target users) and have clearly defined the **benefits** that I want to provide them with.
- [ ] I have clear **hypotheses** about how a new service/digital product will help deliver these benefits.
- [ ] I have mapped out what an **ideal user journey** might look like for a target user of my new service/digital product.
- [ ] I understand the **policy** that relates to my idea and how it might prevent me from delivering a desirable experience for users.
- [ ] I have defined what **success** would look like for my service/digital product and have a plan for how I will **measure** whether it&#39;s being successful.
- [ ] I understand the **scope** of the service/digital product I want to create.
- [ ] I have a prioritised list of **user needs**.
- [ ] I have a prioritised list of **user stories**.
